## Description
Welcome to the "Hangman" game! This Python-based game is designed to be fun. 

By working on this project, I learnt:

- Managing lists in Python.
- Utilising the `random` module for random selections.
- Taking user input and providing feedback.
- Implementing input validation to enhance user experience.

The game aims to guess the hidden word by entering one letter at a time while avoiding too many incorrect guesses.

## Installation
To run the game on your local machine, follow these installation instructions:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tobiy105/hangman280.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd milestone
3. Run the game by executing the following command:
   ```bash
   python milestone_2.py

## Usage
Once the game is running, you can play it by following these steps:

1. The game will display a message asking you to enter a single letter.
2. Enter a letter (make sure it's a single alphabetical character) and press Enter.
3. the game will display "Good guess!" if your guess is valid.
4. If your guess is invalid (e.g., you entered more than one character or a non-alphabetical character), the game will display "Oops! That is not a valid input."
5. Keep guessing until you correctly guess the word or rerun the game for a new word
