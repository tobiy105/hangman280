## Description
Welcome to the "Hangman" game! This Python-based game is designed to be fun. 

By working on this project, I learnt gain hands-on experience in:

- Managing lists in Python.
- Utilising the `random` module for random selections.
- Taking user input and providing feedback.
- Implementing input validation to enhance user experience.

The game aims to guess the hidden word by entering one letter at a time while avoiding too many incorrect guesses.
